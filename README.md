# Tetrahedron
Goal:
  Develop classes Point and Tetrahedron. Create methods and tests: to calculate the surface area of the figure and its volume, as well as the ratio of volumes obtained by dissecting the figure with the coordinate plane; whether the object is a given figure; whether the base of the figure is on one of the coordinate planes.
